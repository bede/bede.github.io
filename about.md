I am a senior computational biologist at the University of Oxford interested in scalable bioinformatics for pathogen genomics. I currently work on methods for quickly, accurately, and privately analysing genomic sequence data for pathogens such as SARS-CoV-2 and *Mycobacterium tuberculosis* using cloud computing. I also enjoy cycling and taking photographs.
