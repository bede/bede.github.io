I develop scalable informatics for infectious disease genomics. I am a research fellow at the University of Birmingham working on the [ARTIC](https://artic.network) project, and academic visitor of the [Modernising Medical Microbiology](https://www.expmedndm.ox.ac.uk/modernising-medical-microbiology) group in Oxford.
